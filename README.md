## UVas 
Directory where I keep my solutions to UVas problems organized by problem id. The solutions are provided in c: all of theme need to be compiled, and most of them require input from command line. 
The problems are mainly about _DIVIDE ET IMPERA_, _backtracking_, _dynamic programming_ and _greedy_ algorithm patterns.
