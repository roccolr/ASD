# Algorithm and Data Structure
Algorithm and data structures exam support repository (University of Napoli FEDERICO II,  computer engineering).


## UVas 
Directory where I keep my solutions to UVas problems organized by problem id. The solutions are provided in c: all of theme need to be compiled, and most of them require input from command line. 
The problems are mainly about _DIVIDE ET IMPERA_, _backtracking_, _dynamic programming_ and _greedy_ algorithm patterns. 
Be aware that the problems as I present it here cannot be subscribed to _online judge_ because I preferred the input from the command line, and, where possibile, I implemented recursive solutions in order to train myself to think in that way. 

## Homeworks 
Directory where I keep my homework compiled in LaTeX, with a pdf output for each one. 

## Common Patterns
I stored some common patterns examples in the directory common_patterns. Check it for some tips about backtracking and dynamic programming.

## Prove Esame
Directory where I kept some solutions to old final exam questions.
